## Introduction
Welcome to the conditional tokens tutorial. In this tutorial we will use [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) (a browser based integrated development environment tailored for ethereum development) and this [gist](https://gist.github.com/cag/65dc3ddfa03f067dd41ca7121ee3120f) to explore the conditional tokens contracts. Along the way, we will explain some of the design choices that were made and what conditional tokens allow you to do.

First off, what are conditional tokens?

In a nut shell conditional tokens enable prediction markets; markets about the outcome of any future event. They allow agents to aggregate beliefs about the future.

Conditional tokens also enable combinatorial prediction markets. These are prediction markets with a deeper structure than what one might typically encounter as prediction markets, allowing you to express more complex logic between combinations of markets.

There may use cases that are enabled by conditional tokens, but today will only be exploring the basic mechanics around the conditional tokens. If you would like more information, please consult the docs.
